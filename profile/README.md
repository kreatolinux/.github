# Kreato Linux
Kreato Linux is an independent Linux(R) distribution focused on modularity, simplicity and code readability.

It is inspired from projects such as KISS Linux and Gentoo.

# Try it out!
One of the easiest ways to try Kreato Linux is by using Docker.

Our images exist both in GitHub Packages and Docker Hub. You can pull from whatever you want. The result will be the same.

Pull the image: `docker pull kreato/builder:latest` or `docker pull ghcr.io/kreatolinux/builder:latest`

And run it: `docker run -it kreato/builder bash`

# Get Started
To compile a rootfs, you can use [kreastrap](https://github.com/kreatolinux/src)

# Contributing
You can package things to [kpkg-repo](https://github.com/kreatolinux/kpkg-repo), improve code quality on Kreato Linux projects, or just be a tester and test the latest Docker and rootfs tarball builds.

You can find documentation of how to package things on the manpages [on the source tree](https://github.com/kreatolinux/src).

Kreato Linux has a lot of projects and i do make mistakes. My code quality might be bad in some areas, but you can always contribute and improve them!

Or you can be a tester and test the latest builds, which helps out more than you think!
