# Kreato Linux
Kreato Linux is an independent Linux(R) distribution focused on modularity, simplicity and code readability.

It is inspired from projects such as KISS Linux and Gentoo.

# Get Started
To compile a rootfs, you can use [nyaastrap](https://github.com/kreatolinux/nyaastrap)

# Contributing
You can package things to [nyaa-repo](https://github.com/kreatolinux/nyaa-repo), improve code quality on Kreato Linux projects, or just be a tester and test the latest Docker and rootfs tarball builds.

You can find documentation of how to package things on the manpages [on the nyaa repository](https://github.com/kreatolinux/nyaa).

Kreato Linux has a lot of projects and i do make mistakes. My code quality might be bad in some areas, but you can always contribute and improve them!

Or you can be a tester and test the latest builds, which helps out more than you think!
