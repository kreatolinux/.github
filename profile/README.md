# Kreato Linux
Kreato Linux is an independent Linux(R) distribution focused on modularity, simplicity and code readability.

It is inspired from projects such as KISS Linux and Gentoo.

Try it out with Docker! `docker run -it kreato/linux bash`

# Get Started
To compile a rootfs, you can use [nyaastrap](https://github.com/kreatolinux/nyaastrap)

# Contributing
You can package things to [nyaa-repo](https://github.com/kreatolinux/nyaa-repo), improve code quality on Kreato Linux projects, or just be a tester and test the latest Docker and rootfs tarball builds.

You can find documentation of how to package things on the manpages [on the nyaa repository](https://github.com/kreatolinux/nyaa3).

Kreato Linux has a lot of projects and i do make mistakes. My code quality might be bad in some areas, but you can always contribute and improve them!

Or you can be a tester and test the latest builds, which helps out more than you think!
